                  <p>In August 2017, white supremacists and Neo-Nazis held a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. This was not a
                    rally where some white supremacists happened to show up - the rally was organized and attended solely by
                    self-identified white supremacists and Neo-Nazis, with the goal of unifying the American white nationalist
                    movement <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally'>[1]</a></p>
                  <p>The rally was attended by David Duke and other members of the Ku Klux Klan. Attendees could be heard chanting
                    "Jews will not replace us", "Blood and Soil" (a Nazi slogan <a
                      href='https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/nazi-germany/blood-and-soil/'>[2]</a>) and "We love Russia".</p>
                  <p>These white nationalists believe that Trump is fighting for their beliefs. In an interview on the morning of
                    the rally, David Duke said, "We are determined to take our country back. We're going to fulfill the promises
                    of Donald Trump. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back."
                  </p>
                  <p>On August 15, 2017, Trump held a press conference where he was hesitent to condemn the rally attendees, and
                    stated, "you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on
                    both sides." <a

                  <p>The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio oversaw the "worst pattern of racial
                    profiling in U.S. history". The illegal tactics that he was using included "extreme racial profiling and
                    sadistic punishments that involved the torture, humiliation, and degradation of Latino inmates". <a

                  <p>Arpaio built a tent camp for migrant children which he once proudly referred to as a "concentration camp"
                    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7reZOp2Qco'>[2]</a>. In this camp, Latinos were detained, often illegally, purely based on their appearance and assumed
                    immigration status. In many instances, officers detained lawful Latino residents for hours, days, or weeks
                    based on fabricated or exaggerated charges.

                    <li>Deputies allegedly put Spanish-speaking inmates in solitary confinement as punishment for not
                      understanding English</li>
                    <li>Jail staff regularly referred to detainees as "wetbacks" "Mexican bitches" and "stupid Mexicans"</li>
                    <li>Detainees were cruelly and illegally deprived of food and medical care</li>
                    <li>The tent camp was outdoors where detainees were exposed to extreme heat in the Summer, and extreme cold in
                      the winter, with very little clothing or other means of sheltering from the elements</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Trump referred to Arpaio as an "American Patriot" <a

                  <p>"By pardoning Joe Arpaio, Donald Trump has sent another disturbing signal to an emboldened white nationalist
                    movement that this White House supports racism and bigotry." According to ACLU deputy legal director Cecilia
                    Wang, the pardon was "a presidential endorsement of racism". <a

                  <p>"Sheriff Arpaio has made public statements that a fact finder could interpret as endorsing racial profiling,
                    such as stating that, even lacking 287(g) authority, his officers can detain people based upon 'their speech,
                    what they look like, if they look like they came from another country'... Moreover, he acknowledges that MCSO
                    provides no training to reduce the risk of racial profiling, stating 'if we do not racial profile, why would I
                    do a training program?'" </p>

                  <p>In 1989 a woman was brutally raped in Central Park, the point of memory loss, brain damage, extreme injury
                    and a 12 day coma. In the same night, attacks by predominately black teenagers were reported in the Central
                    Park area. NYPD arrested 14 teenagers, and charged 5 with the rape. During their interrogation, the 5
                    teenagers "confessed" to the rape after being coerced, attacked and denied their rights by NYPD. This case is
                    historical, because it brought to light the seriousness of false and coerced confessions. Despite indisputable
                    evidence, these teenagers were convicted of rape and served prison time. In 2001, a convicted murdered and
                    serial rapist confessed to the rape, evidence proved his confession was genuine. It wasn't until 2002 that the
                    Central Park 5 Falsely accused were released. <a

                    Trump again insisted "You have people on both sides of that. They admitted their guilt. If you look at Linda

                 <p>This event was the basis for the 2019 impeachment of Donald Trump.</p>
                 <p>In September 2019, a whistleblower complaint raised concerns about Trump using his presidential powers to solicit foreign intervention in the US electoral process. The complaint was specifically around a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to open investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The request came directly after discussing congressionally-mandad military funds to Ukraine, after which Trump said, "I would like you to do us a favor though." <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal'>[1]</a></p>
                 <p>The White House has confirmed several of the allegations, and has provided a non-verbatim transcript of the phone call. <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf'>[2]</a></p>
                 <p>In January 2020, the Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan watchdog agency, concluded that the White House broke federal law by withholding the aid. Specifically, the White House violated the Impoundment Control Act, which states that the government "does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons." <a href='https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796806517/trump-broke-the-law-in-freezing-ukraine-funds-watchdog-report-concludes'>[3]</a></p>

                  Commuted the prison sentence of Roger Stone, convicted of obstruction, witness tampering and five counts of making false statements to Congress

                  <p>Roger Stone came under investigation for his ties to Russia and WikiLeaks during the 2016 election. Stone appeared to have insider information on the 20,000 leaked emails belonging to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. When questioned by Congress on the source of his information, Stone claimed that his source was radio host Randy Credico. Prosecutors later found evidence that his true source was Jerome Corsi, a right wing conspiracy theorist. In an email dated August 2, 2016, Corsi told Stone that WikiLeaks planned to release "very damaging" information about Clinton.</p>
                  <p>Randy Credico testified that Stone had threatened him and his therapy dog in an attempt to prevent him from testifying before Congress. In an apparent reference to the "Godfather" movies, Stone said, "I'm going to take that dog away from you. Not a fucking thing you can do about it either because you are a weak piece of shit." In another exchange, Stone said, "Let's get it on. Prepare to die,cocksucker."</p>
                  <p>These threats were successful, and resulted in Credico invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying before the Committee.</p>
                  <p>Stone also claimed that he never had any written communications referencing Assange, when in fact several text messages and emails were found referencing WikiLeaks and Corsi. <a href='https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/roger-stones-crimes/'>[1]</a></a></p>
                  <p>Stone was also convicted of obstructing the Russia investigation. He claimed that he has nothing to do with Russia, however several emails were found between Stone and the Russian hacker accused of the cyberattack on the DNC. <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-roger-stone-why-is-fbi-investigating-him-2017-3'>[2]</a></a></p>
                  <p>Stone is a loyal Trump supporter, and has promised to remain loyal to the President. "I will never roll on Donald Trump." <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/us/politics/trump-roger-stone.html'>[3]</a> In an interview with NBC's Howard Fineman, Stone said, "I had 29 or 30 conversations with Trump during the campaign period,” he reminded me. “He knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him. It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn’t. They wanted me to play Judas. I refused." <a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/trump-will-commute-ally-roger-stones-prison-sentence-source-tells-nbc-news.html'>[4]</a> </p>
                  <p>Trump's decision to commute Stone's sentence is unprecedented, and spurred an op-ed by Rober Mueller where he stated, "When a subject lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of the government’s efforts to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable. It may ultimately impede those efforts."</p>
                  <p>Senator Mitt Romney called the commutation "Unprecedented, historic corruption"</p>

                  <p>In March 2020, at the request of auto manufacturers, the Trump administration finalized its rollback of Obama-era climate regulations on emissions standards. The new rules reduces the 5% increase in carbon dioxide emissions standards to 1.5%. The Trump administration originally proposed freezing the standards completely, but compromised at the 1.5% after pushback from both environmental groups and the auto makers who requested the rollbacks in the first place.</p>

                    A common misconception is that family separation was started under the Obama
                    administration. While it is true that the holding facilities were built under Obama's administration, their
                    purpose was originally to hold children who had arrived unaccompanied at the border. This was to provide
                    temporary shelter until they could be relocated to a family member.  <a

                    <p>
                    The Trump administration implemented a <b>new</b> family separation policy for the purpose of punishing families arriving at the border. This has affected families immigrating illegally, but has also affected families who are legally seeking asylum. <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/trump-admin-ran-pilot-program-separating-migrant-families-2017-n887616'>[2]</a>

                    <strong>February 28, 2020:</strong> Trump fumbles when detailing his adminstration's response to the virus:
                    "We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering
                    unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical." <a

                    hoax: "Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re
                    politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good,

                    over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think

                    <strong>February, 2020:</strong> By the end of February, the WHO has shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60
                    countries. The US declined to receive any of the tests, stating the CDC would produce its own test. When the
                    CDC does release its own test, the initial tests were faulty. <a

                    better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get
                    better." <a

                    tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect.

                    about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president."

                  <p>The Washington Post has kept a running tally of each Presidential visit to a Trump-owned property. As of September, Trump has visited his own properties 274 times. This equates to over 6 visits per month on average throughout his presidency.</p>
                  <p>Government documents show that the Trump Organization has charged as much as $650 per room per night. In one case, records show that the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service $17,000 per month to rent a 3 bedroom cottage, a rate that is unusually high for comparable rental homes in that area. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-spending-bedminster/2020/09/17/9e11e1c2-f6a0-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html'>[1]</a></p>
